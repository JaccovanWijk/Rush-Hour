# Rush-Hour
In this project we tried to solve the Rush Hour game with multiple algorithms, some provided with multiple heuristics. Rush Hour is a pretty simplistic boardgame with rules that are easy to undesrtand. However, solving this problem with algorithms becomes quite complex.

The board is a square of six by six, nine by nine or twelve by twelve with cars of length two or three spread out across the board. Cars are only allowed to go straight, forward an backwards. The goal of the game is to move a certain car, the red car, to the exit, which is positioned on the third, fifth or seventh row on the right side. 

Our goal is to use different algorithms and try to solve the seven given beginboards in the shortest amount of time possible, or the shortest amount of moves possible. 

# Getting Started
The code is written in Python3.6.5. To run this code you can install the requirements.txt with pip. You can do this with the following command:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
